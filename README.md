<h2>Chapter 1: Setting up a Virtual Machine</h2>
 <p>I am using Windows, so WSL2. The book uses VirtualBox which I have used in the past but I prefer to setup VMs using KVM or Hyper-V for practice.</p>
 <p>Its suppose to be Ubuntu on a Virtual Box VM, WSL2 is already Ubunutu running parallel but it has to be configured to allow KVM nested virtualization.</p>
